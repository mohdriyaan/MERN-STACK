To understand the placement of items , we need to define some important terms that are used often in CSS.

The first thing is we create a container that contains all the items , and this is usually div and it's called 
Grid Container.

The items that are placed inside the grid are called Grid items.

When we create and size our grids , we create these rows and columns. These are collectively known as tracks.
We have row tracks and column tracks.
We create and size these tracks using grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns.

Within the intersection of these tracks, we create these small units called Grid cell.They are smallest unit 
in grid and they can be different sizes. They essentially sit between rows and columns. You can use multiple cells to create
grid item.

The lines seperates our tracks. We have horizontal lines and verticle lines , and these are called the Grid Lines.
We can control these grid lines by using the gap property.

Grid-Column property is shorthand for two other properties:-
grid-column-start
grid-column-end
We can set each of these properties seperately or we can set it using grid-column. 

There is also corresponding property called grid-row which also has 2 other properties:-
grid-row-start and grid-row-end.

We can position the grid items using this property:-
grid-area: 2 / 1 / 3 / 3;
the first value is grid-row-start , 2nd value is grid-column-start, 3rd value is grid-row-end and 4th value is grid-column-end.
