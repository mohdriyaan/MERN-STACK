Flexbox is good for one-dimensional alignment while grid is really good for 2D layouts where you have almost like a table structure with 
columns and rows.

These tools have their own strenghts and weaknesses. So Most Web Developers would use a combination of these two tools alongside other things
such as floats or bootstraps or other frameworks.

Grid Format :-
index.html:-
<div class="container">
    <p>...</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>...</p>
</div>

styles.css
.container{
    display:grid
    grid-template-columns:1fr,2fr;
    grid-template-rows:1fr,1fr;
    gap:10px
}

We can use shorthand for rows and columns:-
grid-template: 1fr 1fr / 1fr 1fr;
