// In JavaScript, undefined represents the absence of a value.

// If a variable is declared but the value is not assigned, then the value of that variable will be undefined.

let name
console.log(name, typeof name)

// It is also possible to explicitly assign undefined as a variable value. 

let a = 10
a = undefined
console.log(a , typeof a) // undefined
console.log(b , typeof b) // not defined
