Web Developers in short build and maintain websites. 

They often work for clients who want's their product or service onto the web. The work can either be solo or involves team collaboration to 
facilitate the needs of the client into the end product.
The work could involve front-end , back-end, or full stack web development. 
The client can be technological company, govermental organization or an individual.

The Front-end is usually the stuff we see on the website. It involves presentation of the content and user-interface elements such as navigation bar.
We generally use HTML,CSS,Javascript to work on front-end. Along with that frameworks such as React.js, Angular.js are also used to provide good user experience.

The Back-End is usually all the operations that goes behind the front-end . All the operations takes place in the server where all the data of the website is being stored.
We use programming languages such as Python, Ruby and JavaScript to work on data. 

Full-stack developers are comfortable working with both the front and back ends.

What is a computer??

A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information or data. It sees the data as 1's and 0's but can combine together to interpret complex things such as images,
movies,games etc. The computer consists of hardware and software.

The hardware consists of inner components such as RAM, Memory devices, CPU, etc and external components such as mouse, monitor, 
keyboard. The software are a set of instructuctions that tells the hardware what to do. EX:- Browser, software applications.

There are different types of computers such as desktops, laptops, smartphones, etc. And these devices will have different OS such as Windows,MacOS,Android,iOS.

Servers are used to send the information to other computers over the network. Whenever we search on the browsers , the servers are responsible for sending the requested webpages.
They are used by companies to store, retrieve or share the data.

Since the computer knows only 1's and 0's , that's where OS comes into place. The OS allows the users to interact with the computers directly. The OS is responsible for 
managing and coordinating the hardware and software components of the computer.
Modern OS uses graphical user interfaces (GUI) to simplify the interaction between the user and computer.
Some of the popular OS are Windows, macOS , Linux.

The applications are computer programs that are used to perform the tasks or can be used for fun.
They run in the operating systems. Some of the examples include Word processors , Browsers, etc.

The source code is a technical blueprint that entails how the program functions. When the product or software is built completely , it is upon the creators to choose the source 
code to be closed-source (proprietary software) and open-source.
The open-source code is available to the public and the programmers can read and modify the source code as well.
Many programers can collaborate to the source to remove bugs and improve the efficiency. 
The closed-source code is not available to the public and is more stable and focused product.
