Media Queries Format :-
@media (max-width:600px){
    h1{
        font-size:15px;
    }
}

This essentially says that at this breakpoint ( in the above case particular width that is less than or equal to 600px ) , then you
should use this styling in here.

Alternatively, you can use min-width for going to the other direction of rensponsiveness. That is styling is applied when the particular width of the screen is more or 
equal to 600px.

We can also combine different breakpoints to target screens between particular widths.
Format:- @media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 900px){
                /*Styles for screens between 600px and 900px*/
         }
         
         @media (max-width: 600px) and (min-width: 900px){
                /*Styles for screens less than 600px and greater than 900px*/
         }
