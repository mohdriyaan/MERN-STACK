There are 3 common display values that are used in CSS:-

1. Inline
When we add another element , it will go into the same line until we no longer fit into the width of the web page in which case they will go 
to the next line. In this property, you cannot set size to the elements.
Ex:-<h1>Harry</h1>
    <h1>Potter</h1>

CSS:-h1{
        display:inline;
     }

Output:- Harry Potter

2. Block 
By default, most elements have this display property set to a value called "block".
Ex:- h1{
        display:block;
     }
Output:- Harry
         Potter

3.Inline-block
In this property, we can set sizes to the element as well as allow us to have elements that go in to the same line.

4.None
In this property, it's going to make any element on the screen disappear.
