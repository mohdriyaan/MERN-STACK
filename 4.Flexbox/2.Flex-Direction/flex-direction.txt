By default, the flex direction is set to row.
When you have flex-direction set to row, then you are setting something called the main axis.
Main Axis is horizontal from left to right.

And then there's something called cross axis. It goes perpendicular to the main axis. It goes from top to bottom.
Format:-flex-direction:column;

flex-basis:100px;
It will expand along the main axis to satisfy the requirement of the flex-basis.
