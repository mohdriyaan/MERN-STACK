Format:-
<div class="container">
    <div class="one"><p>...</p></div>
    <div class="two"><p>...</p></div>
    <div class="three"><p>...</p></div>
</div>

.container{
    display:flex;
    gap:10px;
}

When we declare something display:flex, it gives a little bit of the control to Flexbox to layout our content in a reasonable and commonly desired way.
Flexbox wraps all the elements within the container that has the 100% width and all the elements are inline and their width will be based on the content 
size.
