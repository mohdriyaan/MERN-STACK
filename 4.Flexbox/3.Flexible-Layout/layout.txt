To rearrange the layout in the flexbox , we will use the order property.
By default, everything has an order of 0, so they are arranged by their order in the HTML.

When you run out of space in the row, we use the property flex-wrap: nowrap; . New items gets added on here at the right.
When we decrease the screen width , in order to wrap the elements , we change this property flex-wrap to wrap instead.
flex-wrap is the property of the parent that is the container.

justify-content:flex-start;
It is set on the parent container. It basically sets the distribution of our items along the main axis.Everything is going to be bunched up
to the left.

And the opposite of that is flex-end, where everything gets bunched up all in the end.
justify-content:center; centers the flexbox items. justify-content:space-between allows you to have spacing between different elements.
space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them
space-evenly: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two adjacent alignment subjects, before the first alignment subject, and 
after the last alignment subject is the same.

The next property is align-items.Align-items sets the distribution along the cross-axis.
Ex:- align-items: flex-start;
     height: 70vh; /*vh:- viewport height*/

To set property on independent item , we use align-self:flex-start.

flex-flow:- Combines the properties of flex-direction and flex-wrap.
