Most of the modern web browsers such as Chrome , Firefox , Brave does the same thing that is taking different files such as HTML , 
CSS and JavaScript and then render them into a website.

You can't create a website with just CSS file or just JS File. Howewer , you can just use the HTML File to create a website. 
That's exactly how the old/static websites were created that is with just HTML FIle.

HTML defines the content and structure of the website. In simple words it can be said that HTML is the skeletal system of the website.

HTML Stands For Hypertext Markup Language.

--> Hypertext means the pieces of files/webpages are hyperlinked or hypertexted with each other.

--> Markup means that the files/webpages are treated as manuscripts. 

    -> Markup is done by Tags

    -> Tags can be Headings , Paragraph , body and many more.
