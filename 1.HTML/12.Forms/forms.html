<!-- The form element is used to get information from a user like their name, email, and other details. -->

<!-- Here is an example of a form element with an action attribute: -->

<form action="/submit-url"></form>

<!-- The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent. -->

<!-- The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. Like img elements, input elements are a void element and do not need closing tags. -->

<!-- There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the type attribute. You can easily create a password field, reset button, or a control to let users select a file from their computer. -->

<form action="/submit-url">
    <input type="text">
</form>

<!-- Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an input. -->

<form action="/submit-url">
    <input type="text" placeholder="My Name" >
</form>

<!-- To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the required attribute to an input element. 
There's no need to set a value to the required attribute. Instead, just add the word required to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes. -->

<form action="/submit-url">
    <input type="text" placeholder="My Name" required >
</form>

<!-- The button element is used to create a clickable button. -->
<button>Submit</button>

<!-- The button you added will submit the form by default. However, relying on default behavior may cause confusion. 
Add the type attribute with the value submit to the button to make it clear that it is a submit button. -->

<button type="submit">Submit</button>

<!-- You can use radio buttons for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options. -->
<!-- label elements are used to help associate the text for an input element with the input element itself (especially for assistive technologies like screen readers). -->
<label><input type="radio">Hello</label>

<!-- both radio buttons can be selected at the same time. 
To make it so selecting one radio button automatically deselects the other, both buttons must have a name attribute with the same value. -->
<input type="radio" name="meal"> Breakfast
<input type="radio" name="meal"> Lunch

<!-- Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer. The input element with a type attribute set to checkbox creates a checkbox. -->
<input type="checkbox"> Number1

<form action="submit-url" method="post"></form>
<!-- The method attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL specified in the action attribute. The form-data can be sent via a GET request as URL parameters (with method="get") 
or via a POST request as data in the request body (with method="post"). -->

<!-- The <fieldset> HTML element is used to group several controls as well as labels (<label>) within a web form. -->
