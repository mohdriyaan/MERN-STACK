<!--There is a structure to the HTML files and it looks something like this :-  -->

<!DOCTYPE html> <!--This tells the browser which version of HTML the file was written in. The latest version of HTML is HTML5 -->
<html lang-"en"> <!--This is the root of the document. And the attribute where it says lang="en" , is language of the text content the HTML
will be using in-->
    <head> <!--the head element is an area where the important information about the website is placed that is not going to be displayed to the user
    It includes things that will help the website in the browser render it correctly , but dosen't include any sort of content like text , images
    heading , etc-->
        <meta charset="UTF-8"> <!--The UTF-8 encoding ensure that the characters you will be using in the website will be rendered correctly.
        So for example , in other character sets, it won't allow emojis to be rendered properly as well as symbols such as addition , subtraction.-->
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial scale=1.0"> <!--For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, 
        you need to add a meta element with a special content attribute.-->
        <title>My Website</title> <!--This will get displayed in the tab bar-->
    </head>
    <body> <!--This is where all the content of the website goes-->
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
