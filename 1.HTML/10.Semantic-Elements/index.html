<!-- HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search 
Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility. -->

<!-- The main element is used to represent the main content of the body of an HTML document. Content inside the main element should be unique to the document and should not be repeated in other parts 
of the document. -->

<!-- The section element is used to define sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document. It is a semantic element that helps with SEO and accessibility. -->
