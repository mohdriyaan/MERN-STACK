The most powerful feature of Bootstrap is 12-column system.

The 12-column system is made of three components:-
Firstly we need a div that has the class of "container" and this is going to be starting point.

Next inside that container, we need another div which is going to be of class "row" and inside the row
is where we will have our items and they will be laid out using the column system.

The bootstrap container is responsive.

The layout system can have sized columns. Instead of writing col as the class, we can actually set the class
as for example, col-2 or col-4. We can use col-1 all the way upto the col-12.

Bootstrap has default breakpoints.
Ex:- col-sm-2 
     col-lg-8
It can also have multiple breakpoints such as:-
col-sm-5 col-md-7 col-lg-8
