Bootstrap Framework is one of many external CSS layout systems, but this is probably one of the most popular and the most likely
you will likely come across.

Bootstrap is a CSS Framework created in 2010 by two Twitter developers Mark Otto and Jacob.

It became so popular because it contains pre-made CSS files which you can include in your project in order to use their pre-built 
components and styling.

It has a 12-column layout system built on top of Flexbox.
