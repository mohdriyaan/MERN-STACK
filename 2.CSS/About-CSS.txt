CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

A style sheet is a type of language similiar to the HTML , which is a markup language.
It will specify how things should look in the website.

Earlier in order to differentiate the websites , HTML released many attributes such as color, font and many more. But this made the early 
websites more bulky and heavy weight due to lot of styling content. In order to solve this , CSS was introduced to seperate the styling 
from HTML.
