1. Font size
Ex:-h1{
        font-size:20px
    }

1px :- 1/96th of an inch or 0.26 mm both wide and tall.

Also in place of px , we can also use pt(point) .
1 pt :- 1/72nd of an inch or 0.35 mm both wide and tall.

There are also other ways of representing sizes such as em and rem

1 em :- 100% of parent , em is defined as full width of an m.
For ex. if h1 tag is set as 1em and the body tag is tag is set as 20px, then the h1 tag will be set as 20px 
because body tag is the parent of h1 tag.
If it is set to 2em , then in this case it's going to be two times the parent tag.
It is a relative size to the parent tag size.

1 rem:- 100% of root.
It works similiar to em tag but the catch is it is relative to the root element that is html tag.

2. Font Weight:- 
Ex:-h1{
        font-weight:bold
    }
There are 3 ways of changing font-weight :- Keywords, Relative To Parent and number(100-900).

3. Font Family:-
Ex:-h1{
        font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif
    }
Here Helvetica is a particular typeface, but this a MAC-specific typeface. So very often when we write a font-family, we don't just write 
the font name, we have a comma and then we have a backup generic font type (sans-serif). 
    h2{
        font-family:"Times New Roman",sans-serif
    }

4. Text Align:-
Ex:- h1{
        text-align:center
    }
Aligns the text content on the website to the specified direction.
