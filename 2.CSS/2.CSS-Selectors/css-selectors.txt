Types Of CSS Selectors:-

1. Element Selector
Format:-h1{
            color:red
        }

Here h1 is selector , color is property and red is value.
Element Selector applies property to only the specified selector.

2. Class Selector
Format:-.red-heading{
            color:red
        }

Here .red-heading is class , color is property and red is value.
Class is an attribute that can used to any html element and used for grouping particular elements that have the same tags.
Ex:-<h1>Hello</h1>
    <h1 class="red-heading">Red</h1>

What if we had multiple elements having same class
For Ex:-<h2 class="red-text">Hello</h2>
        <h3>Heading 3</h3>
        <p class="red-text">Hello</p>
In that case the elements having the same class will get the CSS rule applied to them.

3. ID Selector
Format:-#main{
            color:red
        }

Mostly It works similiar to class selector. The difference is class selector applies  to many elements whereas id should be applied to only one lement in a single HTML file , 
It should be unique. ID's are unique to only one element per file and classes can be put on many elements

4. Attribute Selector
Format:-p[draggable]{
            color:red
        }

Select all paragraph elements with draggable attribute and apply the css rule to it.
Ex:- <p draggable="true">Drag Me</p>
     <p>Don't drag me</p>
     <p>Don't drag me</p>

5. Universal Selector
Format:-*{
            color:red
        }
It will apply css rule to everything where the stylesheet is active.
