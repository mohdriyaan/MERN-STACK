There are 4 broad categories which we look at when we're determining the overall level of
importance of a CSS rule :-

1. Position
Ex:-li{
        color:red;
        color:blue;
    }
In this ex. the color blue is applied to li element. So, the lower down the rule is , the more
important it is. 

2. Specificity
It refers to how specific a selector is in terms of the elements that you are applying the CSS rule to.
Ex:- <li id="first-id" class="first-class" draggable>
    CSS file
    li{color:blue};
    .first-class{color:red};
    li[draggable]{color:purple};
    #first-id{color:orange};
From this ex. the order of specificity will be id, attribute, class and element. So acc. to CSS rule of specificity 
the final one in the order will be applied.

3. Type
In terms of cascade, the most important are the styles that are applied inline because this targets only one specific element . The next one is
internal, because the internal stylesheet only exists inside one web page, whereas the external stylesheet can be applied across many different HTML 
files as long as they all are linked to the same CSS file. So then going down the cascade, this is the order where the CSS will get applied.

4. Importance
The keyword that you can apply to any CSS rule, is the "important" keyword.
Ex:- color:red !important;
     color:green;
If you add this keyword then this is going to ensure that this is going to be the most important rule relative to that element. It dosen't matter how 
important the previous rule is, it could have been inline or it is the ID selector or it could have been at the bottom of the page , this rule  will be
implemented.
