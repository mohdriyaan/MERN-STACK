In CSS , every element is treated as a box where we can change the dimensions of those boxes by changing
things such as width and height.

1. Border:-
We can set border on each of the HTML elements.
Ex:- border: 10px solid black;
Here border is a property, 10px is thickness of the border, solid is style of the border and black is the color of
the border.

Now, once you've defined a border, you can further modify it with more specific rules such as border-top, border-bottom,
border-left, border-right.

border-width: 0px 10px 20px 30px; works similiarly to the property above.
The first value is the top, second is the right, third is the bottom and the fourth is the left.

2. Padding:-
Padding is the distance between content and the border.
If we set padding:20px; then it will push the border from the content by 20px in all directions.

3. Margin:-
Margin is actually the part that's outside of the border.

<div> tag:- The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript. 
The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.
