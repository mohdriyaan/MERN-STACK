There are different ways to combine selectors:-

1. Group rule
selector,selector{
    color:violet;
}
CSS rule is applied to both selectors or 2 or 3 different selectors.

2. Child
selector1 > selector2{
    color:red;
}
selector1 is parent and selector2 is child.
Applies the CSS rule to the child through the parent.

3. Descendant
selector1 selector2{
    color: blue;
}
Here selector1 is ancestor , selector2 is descendant

4. Chaining
selectorselector{
    color:green;
}
Apply where all selectors are true

Combining combiners:-
selector selectorselector{
    font-size:2rem
}
